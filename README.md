rzfswizard
==========

This tool was written to allow users to modify their RaiderZ filesystem to include custom content.

It is designed to encourage users to distribute their own content, and does not handle file extraction. However, the project is still in early stages of development and any problems you encounter should be reported (GitHub issues, or by contacting x1nixmzeng).
